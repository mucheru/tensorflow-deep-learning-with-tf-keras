# We will use the Ionosphere binary (two-class) classification dataset to demonstrate an MLP for binary classification.

# This dataset involves predicting whether a structure is in the atmosphere or not, given radar returns.

# The dataset will be downloaded automatically using Pandas

# We will use a LabelEncoder to encode the string labels to integer values 0 and 1. The model will be fit on 67% of the data, and the remaining 33% will be used for evaluation, split using the train_test_split() function.

# It is good practice to use ‘relu‘ activation with a ‘he_normal‘ weight initialization. This combination goes a long way in overcoming the problem of vanishing gradients when training deep neural network models.
